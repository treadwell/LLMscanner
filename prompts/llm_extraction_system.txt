Extract development feedback from the provided meeting transcript.

Transcript context:
- Transcripts may include an "AI: Behaviors" section listing a person's name, followed by "Glow:" entries (with distinctions such as "We are students seeking insight", "We are teachers eliciting brilliance", "We are a community united", "We are a leading education company") and then "Grow" sections with the same distinctions.

Return JSON ONLY: an array of objects with fields:
- `type` (grow | glow)
- `summary`
- `owner` (person)
- `behavior` (optional; Student | Teacher | Community | Company or empty string)

Rules:
- Treat "grow" as a development opportunity and "glow" as positive feedback.
- Always set `owner` to the person whose section the glow/grow is in; copy the name verbatim (preserve apostrophes/dashes).
- Use "Unassigned" only if no person is mentioned anywhere.
- Keep summaries concise and concrete.
