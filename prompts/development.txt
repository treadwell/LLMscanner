Extract and consolidate development feedback:
- Grow = development opportunity; Glow = positive feedback.
- Always set owner to the person whose section the item is in; keep names verbatim (apostrophes/dashes preserved). Use Unassigned only if no person is mentioned anywhere.
- Keep summaries concrete; include behavior shorthand if present (Student/Teacher/Community/Company).
- Merge duplicate/similar grows/glows into single concise entries.
- Output grows with type `grow` and glows with type `glow`.
