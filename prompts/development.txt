Extract and consolidate development feedback:
- Grow = development opportunity; Glow = positive feedback.
- Always set owner to the person whose section the item is in; keep names verbatim (apostrophes/dashes preserved). Use Unassigned only if no person is mentioned anywhere.
- Keep summaries concrete; include behavior shorthand if present (Student/Teacher/Community/Company).
- Do not merge or deduplicate items; return each grow/glow mentioned.
- Output grows with type `grow` and glows with type `glow`, plus optional `behavior` when available.
